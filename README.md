## What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm 
used for predicting continuous values.

Example:
- House Price Prediction
- Salary Prediction
- Sales Forecasting

## Formula

y = b0 + b1x

Where:
y = Target
x = Feature
b0 = Intercept
b1 = Slope

## Key Concepts Covered

- Line of Best Fit
- Cost Function (MSE)
- Gradient Descent (Introduction)
- Assumptions of Linear Regression
- Evaluation Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)
